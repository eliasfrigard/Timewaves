## Analysis
At the beginning of the project we created user stories from the specified project requirements and created a glossary. This document can be viewed [here](docs/analysis.pdf).

We also put together a document with text and video resources of information that could be useful for all team members. We made groups within the teams to work with the three different areas MySQL, Maven, and GitLab, and each group put together information on installation, known problems, and other resources to help members from the all the groups to get going with the new tools. This document can be viewed [here](docs/resources.pdf).

## Sketches
Several sketches of the ui design were made in the beginning of the project by different team members. These sketches can be viewed [here](docs/uisketches.pdf).

## Design
The final design that we decided to use can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/QxDnyqiQRIP2fZYlSg1zsa/TimeWaves?node-id=0%3A1). The name of the application was a part of this design suggestion and therefore also chosen at this time.

## Test cases
Several automated unit tests were made using JUnit5 and TestFX and included in the [project code](src/test/java).
Manual tests were performed throughout the development cycle while implementing the individual features to ensure that everything worked as intended.

## Test results
At the time of the release, all tests pass.
